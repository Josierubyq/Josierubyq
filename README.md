## 🔍 About Me
I have always been curious about a simple question:
Why do humans understand so well, yet machines—despite their scale—still don’t?

Modern models, even large ones, often rely on
surface-level correlations, dense representations, or pattern matching.
Their internal states rarely reflect the kind of organized, explainable knowledge that supports human reasoning.

My research goal is to explore how machine learning systems can develop
more structured, interpretable, and multimodal forms of understanding,
and to design model and agent architectures that better approximate how humans organize information.

This motivation drives all the directions I work in.

I am a final-year CS student at Ritsumeikan University (Osaka, Japan).

Currently a visiting student at **CUHK**, working on **multiagent prompt optimization**, neural bandits, and LLM workflow optimization.

## 🎨 Beyond Research

Outside machine learning, I write quiet pieces of music, take still photographs, and travel to places that change how I see light and shape. I keep a small archive of these creative experiments on Bilibili—simple, personal, and always unfinished.
